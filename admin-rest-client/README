Here is the docker command I'm using to run the client from an embedded container
in this directory:
docker build -t rest-client .
in the interchange directory:
docker-compose -f domain-test.yml up --build
and in another shell (from the interchange directory):
docker run -it --dns 172.28.1.1 -v ${PWD}/keys_sp_kyrre:/jks --network interchange_testing_net --entrypoint /bin/sh rest-client
